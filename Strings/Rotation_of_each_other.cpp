/*
Check if strings are rotations of each other or not
Given two strings s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1. The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case follows. Each testcase contains two lines for s1 and s2.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print "1" if s2 is a rotated version of s1 else print "0".

User Task:
The task is to complete the function areRotations() which checks if the two strings are rotations of each other. The function returns true if string 1 can be obtained by rotating string 2, else it returns false.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 107

Example:
Input:
4
geeksforgeeks
forgeeksgeeks
mightandmagic
andmagicmigth
mushroomkingdom
itsamemario
geekofgeeks
geeksgeekof
Output:
1
0
0
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is forgeeksgeeks. Clearly, s2 is a rotated version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by left-rotating s1 by 5 units.
Testcase 2: Here with any amount of rotation s2 can't be obtained by s1.
Testcase 3: S1 and s2 are completely different strings so s2 can't be obtained by any rotation of s1.
Testcase 4: s1 is geekofgeeks, s2 is geeksgeekof. Clearly , s2 is a rotated version of s1.
